I wrote this so I could\ndirectly serve [GitWeb][node-gitweb] through Node.\n\n\nCGI Scripts?\n------------\n\nIf you're not familiar with CGI scripts, they're simply executable files that\nget invoked by a web server with client requests. The script has Environment\nVariables set that indicate information about the HTTP request the client has sent.\n\nHere's what a simple \"Hello World\" CGI script in `sh` would look like:\n\n``` bash\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Headers are written first. The special \"Status\"\n# header indicates the response status code\necho \"Status: 200\"\necho \"Content-Type: text/plain\"\necho\n    \n# Followed by a response body\necho \"Hello World!\"\n```\n\nLet's call it `hello.cgi`. Be sure to make it executable with `chmod +x hello.cgi`!\n\n\nInvoking \"The Script\" with Node\n-------------------------------\n\nNow, we need to set up our Node HTTP server. For every request sent to the server,\nour `hello.cgi` script will be invoked, and the response will be sent back to the\nHTTP client:\n\n``` javascript\nvar cgi = require('cgi');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar path = require('path');\n\nvar script = path.resolve(__dirname, 'hello.cgi');\n\nhttp.createServer( cgi(script) ).listen(80);\n```\n\nThis will set up a CGI handler with the default options.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[Node]: http://nodejs.org\n[node-gitweb]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gitweb\n[rfc3875]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875\n",
