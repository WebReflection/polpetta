What Is Polpetta
----------------
*polpetta* is a script able to initialize a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) server in any folder you want
`node polpetta ~/path` is basically all you need to start surfing the `~/path` folder as if it is a web-server with the plus that any *file.njs* inside that folder will act as *node.js* module.
Here [the most basic example of an *index.njs* file](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/test/index.njs).

In few words, **polpetta is the easiest way for quick prototyping with both client files and node.js modules**.


Platforms
---------
*polpetta* should just work wherever a recent version of node.js is available.
Known platforms are **Linux**, **Mac**, and **Windows** where for latter one the *polpetta.cmd* file will simply start a polpetta server through double click.


Oh Gosh ... Why
---------------
I am maintaining different projects and I am sick of setting up a web-server per each project.
You might have noticed that most **recent browsers do not let us test through the *file://* protocol anymore** and this is the most annoying thing ever for a developer, imho.
You might be a *node.js* modules developer too and sometimes an easy way to test your modules is all you need.
With *polpetta* you can create as many server as you want per each folder and test them without setting up a damn thing.
Accordingly, if you develop anything for the web or the *node.js* community, *polpetta* could be exactly the solution to all your problems.


Usage
-----
Same as [serverdir](https://github.com/remy/servedir)

    polpetta [path] [port]

  * **path**, the folder you want to use as web-server root, by default is where *polpetta* is
  * **port**, the port you want to use, by default *polpetta* finds a free port automatically

Bear in mind if you specify a port and it's not available, *polpetta* will exit with a notice in console.

If you don't remember later on ... `polpetta --help` or `polpetta -h` to have some hint.


OK, How Do I Start
------------------
Well, the very first step is to grab *polpetta*, either via `git clone git://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta.git` or simply getting the unique file.

You can install *polpetta* through `npm install polpetta -g` or you can grab directly a freshly baked polpetta:

    # go in a directory, if emty is better
    # grab the built file from this repo
    curl -0 https://raw.github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/master/build/polpetta >polpetta

    # if you don't want to make
    # polpetta executable
    # point to polpetta via node
    node ~/the/path/where/is/polpetta

    # if you want make it executable
    # be sure polpetta firstline points to the right
    # bin folder with node then chmod it
    chmod +x polpetta

    # if that is the case, test if it runs via
    # and exit via Ctrl+C or simply go to
    # the http://address:port/ showed and start playing
    ./polpetta

You should see something like this in your console (I have used the /tmp folder here)

![polpetta at work](http://www.3site.eu/images/polpetta_shell.png)


    # if you want make your life easier and call
    # polpetta from anywhere, hoping you have not
    # configured node as super user ( this could hurt )
    which node
    # output: /usr/local/bin/node

    # move the file into that bin folder
    [sudo] mv polpetta /usr/local/bin

    # now, whatever folder you want ..
    polpetta ~/myhtml/only/website/

    # and you are ready to go

If you want clone this repository, help me improving *polpetta* or do some test/change, remember to `make` in order to build *polpetta* in the build folder then `node build/polpetta ../test` or any other path you like.


Make options
------------
  * **build**, the default one, creates a freshly new backed *polpetta* in the *build/* folder
  * **clean**, remove the build folder and everything included
  * **types**, grab the Apache file, parse it, overwrite the [EXTENSION_TO_MIME.js](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/src/EXTENSION_TO_MIME.js) file and build *polpetta* again


What About .njs Files
---------------------
If the file extension is **.njs** it is **executed PHP style** but with the whole power of node.js.
You can `require("module")` and do what you want and you receive per each web-server call the **request** and the **response** object.
All you have to do in your file is to export an `onload` function. This function will be called with a spiced up *polpetta* with some utility but you don't really have to use them, just do what you want.

    // generic.njs file
    this.onload = function (
      request,
      response,
      polpetta
    ) {
      var fs = require("fs");
      fs.writeFileSync("gotcha.txt", "it works");
      response.end();
      // note that polpetta here points
      // to a polpetta clone enriched
      // with some utility
      // and an output object
    };


What About External npm Modules
-------------------------------
There are two options here, the easy one and the even easier.
The easy one is about cloning the repository, perform `npm install mymodule` inside the repository, use *make* and discover that **modules are also included in the *build/* folder**.
Since that is gonna be the folder where the application is running in any case, modules are resolved through `require()` via that folder.
If you want to keep updated the globally executable *polpetta*, you might decide to add this line to the *Makefile* build process: `cp -R build/* /usr/local/bin`

The even easier way is to install your most used modules globally via `npm install module -g` so that these will be available in any case through the node.js `require()` mechanism and you update one place rather than all of them, if necessary.


Polpetta API
------------
You can find almost everything documented in the [polpetta.js](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/src/polpetta.js) file.
What you won't find there is a `polpetta.get(key[, default])` method, used to retrieve query string properties as it is for the PHP `$_GET[$key]` global, a `polpetta.post(key[, default])` method to retrieve posted data, a `polpetta.cookie(key[, default])` method, to get cookie, followed by `polpetta.cookie.set(key, value)` to set them.
All these objects have a `obj.keys()` method too to retrieve all parsed keys for *get*, *post*, *cookie*, or *file*.

You can see an examples for [cookie](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/test/cookie.njs), [get or post](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/test/post.njs), and [files upload](https://github.com/WebReflection/polpetta/blob/master/test/file.njs) in the test folder.

Last, but not least, there is a `polpetta.output` **Array** property where you can push your content and `polpetta.output.flush([type || [code, type]])` once you have done.
Bear in mind this is not a good technique to serve big files on the fly but that's not the purpose of the `output` property.

    // example of get and output
    this.onload = function (req, res, p) {
      p.output.push(
        "Hello ",
          p.get("name",
            // default if not present
            "unknown"
          ),
        "!"
      );
      p.output.flush("txt");
    };

    // produced output for localhost:port
    Hello unknown!

    // produced output for localhost:port/?name=Polpetta
    Hello Polpetta!


TODOs
-----
  * add .htaccess like mechanism for the root folder as ..
    * hidden file from any folder request ( no ajax, images, etc ... )
    * one shot requiring during initialization and as node module
    * possibility to intercept 404, 500, and all others
    * possibility to serve different content per extension ... e.g. .md files
    * rewrite rules through JS regexp
    * something else I am still thinking about ...
  * add default favicon with polpetta logo
  * I believe after that there's not much left, except creating automation tests through phantom js and wru

Polpetta means meatball and I am not a graphic designer at all ... so this is all I could do but if you want to create a better logo, you'll be credited and I'll pay you a beer, cheers :D
